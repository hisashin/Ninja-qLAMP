The configuration for each version can be found in HardwareConf.cpp and HardwareConf.h.
HardwareConf class has two construction methods for two models:

* ver0.9 (initFirstModel)
* ver1.0 (initLCDModel)

Pins, thermistors, PID constants and some model-specific properties for NinjaLAMP's basic functionalities are defined in HardwareConf::initFirstModel() function.

## ver0.9

ver0.9 has no dedicated user interfaces. It sends values every 250ã€€milliseconds by serial communication.
The values can be plotted by the serial plotter of Arduino IDE. This process is implemented in the loop function.

## ver1.0

In April, ver0.9 was released just after a week of rapid prototyping by @hisashin and @maripo. Now @hisashin upgraded its PCB and 3d model  to ver1.0 with widely used [Seeeduino Xiao](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/), [I2C SSD1306 LCD](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33028828291.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.26274c4dPiM0Ki), [I2C 2kb EEPROM](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stmicroelectronics/M24C02-RMN6TP/2038677) and 3 tact switches.

NinjaLAMP will get following benefits from this upgrade.

- **Standalone** : No need to be connected to PC anymore. LCD displays all informations and we can choose menu by tapping switches as up/down/ok buttons.
- **Programmable** : We can configure custom temperature profiles with switches and store them in EEPROM.
- **Manufacture Friendly** : PCB supports [Seeed PCBA](https://www.seeedstudio.com/prototype-pcb-assembly.html) service and here is their quotation. All electric parts are included and soldered except $1.66 LCD and $0.46 thermistor. With $10 heater and $10 tube holder, NinjaLAMP can be manufactured less than $40. That's great advantage for screening mass poplulation.

## How to Setup IDE and test ver1.0

* Connect NinjaLAMP to your computer with USB TypeC cable. No need to connect 12V AC adapter at first.
* NinjaLAMP ver1.0 uses [Seeeduino XIAO](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/)(not AVR but SAMD21). Follow their **[Software Step 1 to 5](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/#software)**
* Upload **"File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink"** to NinjaLAMP. Orange LED next to USB connector will start blinking.
* Go to **Sketch-> Include Library-> Manage Libraries**, search "ssd1306" and install Alexey Dynda's **[ssd1306 library](https://github.com/lexus2k/ssd1306)**.

* Add "NinjaLAMPCore" library to the build environment. Choose Sketch > Add .ZIP Library... and select arduino/lib/NinjaLAMPCore.zip.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/master/images/ssd1306.png" alt="ssd1306" width="500">

* Restart Arduino IDE
* Upload **"File > Examples > ssd1306 > demos > ssd1306_demo"** to NinjaLAMP. I2C LCD displays [demo](https://github.com/lexus2k/ssd1306/blob/master/examples/demos/ssd1306_demo/ssd1306_demo.ino).
* Clone this NinjaLAMP respository to somewhere
* Upload [NinjaLAMP/arduino/examples/xiao_example_gpio](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/tree/master/arduino/examples/xiao_example_gpio)
* Click magnifying glass icon at the top-right corner and set rate to "9600 baud"
* Tap switches to change values. If adapter is connected, tube holder will be heaten. Be careful.

* Upload [NinjaLAMP/arduino/examples/xiao_example_eeprom](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/tree/master/arduino/examples/xiao_example_eeprom)
* Click magnifying glass icon at the top-right corner and set rate to "9600 baud"
* Program writes 0x32(=50) at address 0 of EEPROM on board with writeI2CByte(). Then readI2CByte() read the value of the same address.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/master/images/xiao_example_eeprom.png" alt="ssd1306" width="500">

* Change (address, value) from (0, 0x32) to another. You can confirm its's saved correctly.
