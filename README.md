# Ninja qLAMP

**2022Feb25 : [Ninja qPCR](https://github.com/hisashin/Ninja-qPCR) is almost done. We're importing its optical unit to NinjaLAMP to make Ninja qLAMP.**

**Most precise GPL v3 Open source [LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal amplification)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-mediated_isothermal_amplification) machine based on Arduino**. Less than 0.3 degree celsius accuracy can be expected after calibration.

### Why NinjaLAMP?
- **Precise** with thermal simulation model sensing not only tube holder but air
![Simulation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/master/images/heat_simulation/illustration_s.png)
- **Easy to build** : Only 4 resistors, 1 mosfet, 2 thermistors are indespensable on [circuit](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/tree/master/eagle).
- **Easy to use** : [Monitor and control](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/wiki/Run-and-monitor-temperature-graph) via SerialPlotter of Arduino.
- **Easy to custom** : [Calibration manual](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/wiki/How-to-use-simulated-sample-temperature) allows you to change core parts.

### Steps

- [BOM (Bill of materials)](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/wiki/BOM,-Bill-of-Materials) to buy
- Solder parts on universal breadboard like bottom photos of [this page](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/tree/master/eagle) or order PCB.
- 3d print [base](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/blob/master/3d/4x4_3d_base.stl) and [cover](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/blob/master/3d/4x4_3d_cover.stl) upside down without support. Use [belt](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaLAMP/blob/master/3d/4x4_3d_belt.stl) to hold PCB or glue.
